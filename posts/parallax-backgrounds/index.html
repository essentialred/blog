            <h1>Parallax Background Methods: A Performance Review</h1>
            <h2>Everyone says not to do it.  Except clients.</h2>
            <h3>So here are some options for saving performance while you do the inevitable.</h3>

            <h2>Pure CSS</h2>
            <h3>Background-size</h3>
            <h3>Background-attachment</h3>
            <h3>Weird Bugs</h3>
            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>
                This is clearly the most charming solution.  It is developer-friendly, minimal code, and no JS.  It should absolutely be the first one to try if you're looking for a solution to making one or two banners on your website fancy and the rest of the template is fairly static.  I have made the mistake, however, of going down this road for a much more animation-heavy experience where there were many other elements moving on scroll or at fixed points, and the strange bugs listed above became prohibitive. There are also performance issues when you have a large layout employing the cover/fixed CSS solution to create the illusion of full-page panels.  As soon as more elements and greater demands are made on your parallax layout, this solution becomes questionable at best.  I still hope that browser evolution will catch up to us and that someday fullscreen, pure-CSS parallax panels will be butter-smooth and cooperative!  Until then, read on.

            <h2>With JavaScript</h2>
            <h3>Background-size</h3>
            <h3>Update background-position on scroll</h3>
            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>
                While this solution does give you fine-grain control over how strong you want the parallax effect to be (how fast should the background move), the performance is still shaky due to the use of background-size causing those repaints on every scroll.

            <h2>With JavaScript, no BG size</h2>
            <h3>Using Images</h3>
            <h3>Translate Image on scroll</h3>
            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>
                Despite the apparent lack of elegance to this solution, I have been able to achieve the best performance hands-down.
